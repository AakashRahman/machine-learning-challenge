Machine Learning:
Using Machine Learning, Training and Test Data sets were used from a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)of exoplanets to predict their presence. After installing all necessary Libraries and import their dependencies,  best fit the model was used on the data to predict the accuracy.
The testing data score showed 0.86 to be more than the training data score. Hence making the training data the best model. 
A classification report using the test data was then prepared with a higher false positive. 
A report using the training set showed inconsistencies. 
The best fit model created by me can be used in finding theoretical expolanets.
